SPLIT ARRAY, FIND LARGEST SUM ON EACH SPLIT AND SHOW THE SMALLEST SUM ON ALL THE LARGEST SUMS

Given an array which consists of integers, split the array into 2 non-empty continuous sub-arrays.

Find the largest sum on each split.
Compare all those largest sums to find the smallest sum value.

For the initial array, enter each number and press Enter.
To end the input of the array, enter 0.

Example 1:

Input:

7

2

5

10

8

0

smallest sum on all the splits is 18.

Explanation:
There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.

The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.


Example 2:

Input: 

1

2

3

4

5

smallest sum on all the splits is 9.
